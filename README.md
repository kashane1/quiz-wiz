Process:

This was definitely a very challanging assignment. I struggled for hours trying to get the buttons to work properly. I reach a solution that I'm very satisfied with even though I'm aware there is must be better solutions out there. I'm mostly refering to how I organize the buttons to my questions. I needed new buttons for each question, because if I used the same buttons with new values, the old eventListeners started to stack on top of each other and I couldnt figure out a way to prevent this from happening.

I started with pseudo code and got a lot of good ideas going. Worked out the larger layout of the script and then worked on each section of the script. This way help me organize my thoughts. I had a few routes that I felt comfortable taking and I took them all. This is my final product and I'm satisfied with it. I'm also happy to make changes based on my code review because I know it's exactly perfect.

After giving the program another deep look and trying a few more things. I was able to get the highscores page to do exactly what I wanted it to. Which was save multiple scores.
